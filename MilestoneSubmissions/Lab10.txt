1. User should be able to login with correct credentials.
    -The user will submit their username/email and password. Scenario is user is trying to log back into their profile
    -We test the feature with the database and whether the password matches the hash
    -Environment: local host for now until cloud is discussed
    -Expected results: Pass verification and get back to home screen with fully updated profile
    -Testers are any users regardless of role but must have logged in previously, we will create fake profiles to simulate this
2. User registration fails when the user provides invalid credentials.
    -User will submit username, password, and school email into a form that submits to try to create a new user object
    -Use an api to verify school email is real, verify username is unique.
    -Environment: local host for now until cloud is discussed
    -The results should be a newly created user within their corresponding university college rundown page
    -We create fake users to send emails and register
3. If a user is banned, the user is prompted with a message and there are no missing components.
    -A user has been banned from a community by a moderator or admin for profane language in any sense or cyberbullying
    -Test data: banned user’s username, community, banned message
    -Environment: local host for now until cloud is discussed
    -Expected results are the banned user getting a message that they have been banned and they don’t have access to certain areas
    -Test items include a user who gets banned, admin who does banning, message that detects profanity, and community in which message was posted
